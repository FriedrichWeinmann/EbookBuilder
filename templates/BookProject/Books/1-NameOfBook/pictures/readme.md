# Pictures

Add all your picture files in this folder.
You can then later reference those pictures in your document like this:

```text
## <picture>
name.jpeg
## </picture>
```

You can also pass along positioning instructions:

```text
## <picture align="left">
name.jpeg
## </picture>
```

By default, all pictures will be centered.
